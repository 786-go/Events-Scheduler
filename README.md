### Description
This app allows one to schedule one's daily activities/engagements. The CSS helps the UI greatly in the app in that there are always 3 colors in use; current time, previous, and upcoming. The use of Moment.js was a nice feature added at the top as well. 

### Installation
None. The program runs smoothly in the browser. 

### Usage
None. The CSS makes this program intuitive and enjoyable to use.
